## Tools Used

- _(AI 3)_ Windsurf

## What Worked

_Describe what parts of the project went smoothly or turned out well. This could include specific features, code organization, approaches to prompts or workflow habits._

- _(What Worked 1)_ - 
- _(What Worked 2)_ - Cursor followed the layout and home page to the letter. When we encountered an error in the Book model not using a createdAt property, it also fixed the Patron model.
- _(What Worked 3)_ - I intentionally gave a prompt before I was finished entering the explicit instructions on the Patron Detail Route. Windsurf noticed the error, and used the previous patterns of instructions to decide how to best implement the route. It even reasoned that the correct example-markup would be the update_patron.html file when it couldn't find one named 'patron_detail.html'.

## What Didn't Work

_Explain what parts of the project were challenging or didn't go as planned. Did you hit bugs, confusion, or dead ends?_

- _(What Didn't Work 1)_ - Despite me asking GitHub Copilot to stop suggesting seeding the loan db, it kept requesting to do so. Also, attempting to adjust CSS spacing not using specific units (i.e. asking it to increase the space of a column on the table 'a little bit') left a lot of work to do.
- _(What Didn't Work 2)_ - I ran out of credits on Cursor fairly quickly. Kind of wish I didn't do that.
- _(What Didn't Work 3)_ - Windsurf kept attempting to change the database schema in unexpected ways, sometimes suggesting changes that weren't aligned with the project requirements. It also tried to enforce conventions that didn't match the project's existing patterns. It also chose to add multiple form instructions in ways that did not make sense for the project's existing structure.

## Pros / Cons of Using an AI Coding Assistant

### Pros

_What were the benefits of using an AI assistant during this project?_

- _(Benefit 1)_ - As long as I wrote the prompt well, it was easy to discern what, if any, changes needed to be made to the code the assistant created.
- _(Benefit 2)_ - I could prompt the AI assistant and start writing the next prompt while it was coding. While I sometimes had to react to problems, this greatly sped up the process.
- _(Benefit 3)_ -  

### Cons

_What were the downsides, limitations, or challenges when relying on AI during this project?_

- _(Downside 1)_ - Even when given explicit instructions, some AI  assistants would ignore the instructions and do whatever they wanted to do.
- _(Downside 2)_ - Because I'm not the one writing the code, I don't know what it says until I read it. In reality the code could be doing anything and I wouldn't know what it does until the assistant was finished. Having the assistant write long blocks of code, which really saves time, meant I had more code to look at before I could determine everything was in good working order, which really doesn't save time.
- _(Downside 3)_ -
